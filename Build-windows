Instructions for compiling a5a-cpuminer on Windows:

Dependencies:
	libcurl			http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
	libgmp			http://gmplib.org/
	openssl			http://www.openssl.org/
	jansson			http://www.digip.org/jansson/
	(jansson is optional, and is included in-tree)


1. Download and install Cygwin 64 bit setup from http://www.cygwin.com/. Here
is a direct link to the latest version: http://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe

2. Run the setup as administrator. Use defaults until you get to the package
selection screen. Find these packages one by one and click next to them where
it says 'skip' to mark them for installation (skip should change to a version number):

devel/gcc-g++
devel/automake
devel/autogen
devel/make
devel/clang
devel/libc++devel
devel/git
libs/libcurl-devel
libs/gmp
net/openssl-devel

3. Hit next, then next again to mark all dependencies and begin downloading / 
installing packages.

4. Wait a few minutes for everything to finish downloading/installing.

5. Hit finish.

6. Open a cygwin terminal as administrator either by going to Start menu -> Cygwin
-> Cygwin 64 terminal, or runing C:\Cygwin64\cygwin.bat. All future commands are
done from this terminal.

7. Download a5a-cpuminer source from their github using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/androidcoin-project/a5a-cpuminer.git

8. Change dirs:

cd a5a-cpuminer

9. Mark autogen.sh as executable:

chmod +x autogen.sh

10. Run autogen.sh

./autogen.sh

11. Run the configure script, optimizing it for speed:

CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" ./configure

12. Compile it:

make

13. Assuming you have no errors, run it in benchmark mode:

./minerd.exe --benchmark
